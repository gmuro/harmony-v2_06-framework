/**
 * \defgroup timer OEM - Timer Interface
 * 	
 * \details DotStack requires a facility to measure various time intervals.
 * This module declares an interface that the application has to implement in
 * order to provide DotStack with such functionality.
 *
 * The minimum required timer resolution is 100 milliseconds.
 *
 * The maximum number of timers is defined by the \c BT_TIMER_MAX constant.
 *
 * Timer ID values used in the interface are from \c 0 to <tt>BT_TIMER_MAX-1</tt>.
 *
 * The interface consists of the following function:
 *     \li bt_oem_timer_set()
 *     \li bt_oem_timer_clear()
