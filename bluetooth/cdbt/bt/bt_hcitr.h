	@defgroup hcitr OEM - HCI Communication Interface

	@details
	The DotStack library provides several HCI transport protocols (e.g., H4, 3-wire
	protocol). However, the code that actually moves octets of data between the CPU and
	HCI controller is application specific.
	
	This module declares an interface that allows DotStack to communicate with the HCI
	controller. The application has to implement this interface.
	
	The interface consist of the following functions that must be implemented by the
	application:
		\li bt_oem_send()
		\li bt_oem_recv()
 */

/** Send callback.

	This callback function is called when a send operation initiated by bt_oem_send() has
	completed.
*/
typedef void (*bt_oem_send_callback_fp)(void);


/** Receive callback.

	This callback function is called when a receive operation initiated by bt_oem_recv()
	has completed.
	
	@param len Number of received bytes.
		The value of this parameter should always be the same as the number of bytes
		requested in a call to bt_oem_recv().

/** Send data.

	This function is called by the HCI layer when it needs to send data to the HCI
	controller. Implementation of this function must send the specified number of bytes
	to the HCI controller and call the provided callback function. 

	@param buffer Pointer to the data to be sent .
	
	@param len Number of bytes to send.
	
	@param callback A callback function that must be called when all data have been sent.
