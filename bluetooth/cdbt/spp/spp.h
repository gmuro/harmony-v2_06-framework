/** @defgroup spp Serial Port Profile (SPP)

The DotStack SPP API is a simple API for communicating over a Bluetooth link using the
Bluetooth Serial Port Profile.

Here are the steps for using this API:

- Call the bt_spp_init() function.

- Allocate a serial port structure with bt_spp_allocate(). One of the parameters to
 this function is a pointer to a callback function. That callback function will be called
 by the stack whenever the state of the serial port changes.

- To connect to a remote device call bt_spp_connect(). The stack will notify when the
  connection is established by calling the state callback function. 

- To wait for a connection from a remote device call bt_spp_listen(). The stack will
  notify when the connection is established by calling the state callback function. 

- When the port is connected you can send data with bt_spp_send() and receive data with
  bt_spp_receive().
  
- To terminate the connection call bt_spp_disconnect().

- When you are finished using the port deallocate it with bt_spp_deallocate().
