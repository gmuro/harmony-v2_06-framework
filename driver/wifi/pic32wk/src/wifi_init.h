  Function:
        WIFI_initialization()

  Summary:
    Implements PIC32WK Wi-Fi driver initialization.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> static</p>

  Description:
    This function implements PIC32WK Wi-Fi driver initialization.
	User has to ensure PIC32WK Initialization completed before starting any other PIC32WK Wi-Fi driver functionality.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Returns:
    true  - Initialization was successful
    false - Initialization was not successful

  Remarks:
    None.

  Function:
        void do_switchMode()

  Summary:
    Implements PIC32WK Wi-Fi driver switch mode.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> static</p>

  Description:
    This function gives Wi-Fi driver switch mode functionality.
	
	This functionality needed only for STA-AP_Mode where Single application image contain 
	Wi-Fi STA(station) and OOBAP(Out Of Box access point) functionality.
	
	To set the desire boot mode manually ,command is provided to user:
	wlan bootmode <BOOT MODE>
	where BOOT MODE : 0 - PIC32WK boot as STA(station) mode
			          1 - PIC32WK boot as OOBAP(Out Of Box access point) mode
	After setting the mode,User need save the configuration in in-package flash using 
	"wlan save config" command and reboot the PIC32WK device.
					 
  Precondition:
    The Wi-Fi driver should be initialized using WIFI_initialization function call.

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    None.
