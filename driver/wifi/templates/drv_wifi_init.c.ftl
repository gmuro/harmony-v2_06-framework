  File Name:
    drv_wifi_init.c.ftl

  Summary:
    This file contains source code necessary to initialize the Wi-Fi driver.

  Description:
    This file contains source code necessary to initialize the system.  It
    implements the "SYS_Initialize" function, configuration bits, and allocates
    any necessary global system resources, such as the sysObj structure that
    contains the object handles to all the MPLAB Harmony module objects in
    the system.
