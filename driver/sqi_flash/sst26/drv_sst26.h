/* SST26 Driver command handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read, Write, Erase or
    EraseWrite functions. This handle allows the application to track the
    completion of the operation. This command handle is also returned to the
    client along with the event that has occurred with respect to the command.
    This allows the application to connect the event to a specific command in
    case where multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set. 

  Remarks:
    None.

/* SST26 Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a SST26 Driver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SST26 event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value 
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to 
    receive event calls back from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write/Erase/EraseWrite
                      requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MySst26EventHandler
    (
        DRV_SST26_EVENT event,
        DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:
                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:
                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    requested operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was registered using the
    DRV_SST26_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is passed
    back to the client as the "context" parameter. It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations within this function.

  Summary:
    Initializes the SST26 instance for the specified driver index

  Description:
    This routine initializes the SST26 driver instance for the specified
    driver index, making it ready for clients to open and use it.

  Precondition:
    None.
  
  Parameters:
    index -  Identifier for the instance to be initialized
    init -   Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver.
  
  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise it returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.
  
  Example:
    <code>
    // This code snippet shows an example of initializing the SST26 Driver.
    
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ  objectHandle;

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified SST26 driver instance and provides a handle. 
    This handle must be provided to all other client-level operations to identify
    the caller and the instance of the driver.
  
  Preconditions:
    Function DRV_SST26_Initialize must have been called before calling this

             of the driver
  
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).
    
    If an error occurs, DRV_HANDLE_INVALID is returned. Errors can occur
    under the following circumstances:
    	- if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_SST26_CLIENTS_NUMBER 
          is insufficient
    	- if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
    	  exclusively by another client
    	- if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
          been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
    	- if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is

    under the following circumstances:
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request
    - if the target buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for write only
    - if the number of blocks to be read is either zero or more than the number
      of blocks actually available
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SST26_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SST26 driver instance.

    DRV_SST26_Open must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the command handle
                   
    targetBuffer  - Buffer into which the data read from the SST26 Flash memory
                    will be placed

    blockStart    - Read block start address from where the data should be
                    read.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be read.

  Returns:
    The command handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be
    DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>

  Summary:
    Writes blocks of data starting at the specified block start address.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation for writing blocks
    of data into flash memory. The function returns with a valid command handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled
    successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue
    and returns immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application
    buffer is owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function
    returns DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument
    under the following circumstances:
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request
    - if the source buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the number of blocks to be written is either zero or more than the
      number of blocks actually available
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully or DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if the
    buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SST26_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SST26 driver instance.

    DRV_SST26_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle. DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified
    as a parameter to this routine.

    The flash address location which has to be written, must have be erased before
    using the DRV_SST26_Erase() routine.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle
                   
    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed into SST26 
                    Flash

    blockStart    - Write block start address from where the data should be
                    written to.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be written. 

  Returns:
    The command handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be
    DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>
    
    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    
    // Use DRV_SST26_GeometryGet () to find the write region geometry.

  Summary:
    Erase and Write blocks of data starting from a specified block start
    address.

  Description:
    This function combines the step of erasing a sector and then writing the
    page. The application can use this function if it wants to avoid having to
    explicitly delete a sector in order to update the pages contained in the
    sector. 

    This function schedules a non-blocking operation to erase and write blocks
    of data into flash memory. The function returns with a valid command handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled
    successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue
    and returns immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application
    buffer is owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function
    returns DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument
    under the following circumstances:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the number of blocks to be written is either zero or more than the
      number of blocks actually available
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully or DRV_SST26_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if the
    buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SST26_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SST26 driver instance.

    The DRV_SST26_Open() must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as a parameter to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return command
                    handle. If NULL, then command handle is not returned.
                   
    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed into SST26
                    Flash

    writeBlockStart - Write block start address where the write should begin.

    nWriteBlock   - Total number of blocks to be written. 

  Returns:
    The command handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It Will be
    DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not queued.

  Example:

    on. The function may return DRV_SST26_COMMAND_COMPLETED in a case where the
    command handle has expired. A command handle expires when the internal
    buffer object is re-assigned to another request. It is recommended that
    this function be called regularly in order to track the command status
    correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive the
    command completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_SST26_Initialize() routine must have been called.

    The DRV_SST26_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_SST26_COMMAND_STATUS value describing the current status of the command.
    Returns DRV_SST26_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the client handle or the command
    handle is not valid.

  Example:
    <code>

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when queued operation has completed.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.  When a client
    calls a read, write, erase or a erasewrite function, it is provided with a
    handle identifying the command that was added to the driver's buffer queue.
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling
    "eventHandler" function when the queued operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any operations
    that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists until the
    client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which could be a
    "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SST26_Initialize() routine must have been called for the
    specified SST26 driver instance.

    The DRV_SST26_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the
                   user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
