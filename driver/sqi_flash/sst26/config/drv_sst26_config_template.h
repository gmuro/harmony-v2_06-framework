/* SST26 Driver instance configuration

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of Driver instances that can be supported by
    the dynamic driver.

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of Driver instances that can be
    supported by the dynamic driver. In case of this driver, multiple instances
    of the driver could use the same hardware instance.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SST26 maximum number of clients

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of clients

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of clients that the SST26 driver
    can supported at run time. This constant defines the total number of SST26
    driver clients that will be available to all instances of the SST26 driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SST26 Driver maximum number of buffer objects

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of buffer objects

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of buffer objects. This
    indirectly also specifies the queue depth. The SST26 Driver can queue up
    DRV_SST26_BUFFER_OBJECT_NUMBER of read/write/erase requests before return a
    DRV_SST26_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID due to the queue being full. Buffer objects
    are shared by all instances of the driver. Increasing this number increases
    the RAM requirement of the driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SST26 Driver Register with File System

  Summary:
    Register to use with the File system

  Description:
    Specifying this macro enables the SST26 driver to register its services with
    the SYS FS.

  Remarks:
    This macro is optional and should be specified only if the SST26 driver is
    to be used with the File System.
