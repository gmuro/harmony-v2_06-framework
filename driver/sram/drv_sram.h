/* SRAM Driver command handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read or Write functions. This
    handle allows the application to track the completion of the operation.
    This command handle is also returned to the client along with the event
    that has occurred with respect to the command. This allows the application
    to connect the event to a specific command in case where multiple commands
    are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set. 

  Remarks:
    None.

/* SRAM Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

  Summary
    Pointer to a SRAM Driver Event handler function

  Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SRAM event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value 
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to 
    receive event callbacks from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MySramEventHandler
    (
        DRV_SRAM_EVENT event,
        DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SRAM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_SRAM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SRAM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the read or
    write operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_SRAM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_SRAM_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write
    request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver's context. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations within this function.

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified SRAM driver instance and provides a

             "ORed" together to indicate the intended use of the driver
  
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).
    
    If an error occurs, DRV_HANDLE_INVALID is returned. Errors can occur under
    the following circumstances:
        - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_SRAM_CLIENTS_NUMBER
        is insufficient
        - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
        exclusively by another client
        - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has
        already been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
        - if the driver hardware instance being opened is invalid
  
  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;
    
    handle = DRV_SRAM_Open(DRV_SRAM_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);

    the SRAM media.

  Description:
    This routine writes blocks of data starting at the specified block start
    address. This operation is blocking and returns after having written the
    data. If a event handler has been registered to receive the driver events
    then the event handler will be called from within this function. The
    function returns DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle
    argument under the following circumstances:
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the driver state is not ready
    - if the source buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the number of blocks to be written is zero or more than the actual
    number of blocks available
    - if the client opened the driver in read only mode

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SRAM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SRAM driver instance.

    DRV_SRAM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle. DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have
    been specified as a parameter to this routine.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle
                   
    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed into
                    SRAM memory

    blockStart    - Start block address of SRAM media from where the write
                    should begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be written. 

  Returns:
    The buffer handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be
    DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>
    
    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint32_t blockStart = 2;
    uint32_t nBlock = 2;
    DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle;
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;    

    // mySRAMHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SRAM_Open function.
    // Client registers an event handler with driver

    DRV_SRAM_EventHandlerSet(mySRAMHandle, APP_SRAMEventHandler, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj);
    DRV_SRAM_Write(mySRAMHandle, &commandHandle, &myBuffer, blockStart, nBlock);

    if(DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID == commandHandle)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }
    else
    {
        // Write completed successfully.
    }

    // Event is received from within the DRV_SRAM_Write function when the
    // buffer is processed.

  Summary:
    Gets the current status of the command.

  Description:
    This routine gets the current status of the command. The application must
    use this routine where the status of a scheduled command needs to be polled
    on. The function may return DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_COMPLETED in a case where the
    command handle has expired. A command handle expires when the internal
    buffer object is re-assigned to another read or write request. It is
    recommended that this function be called regularly in order to track the
    command status correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive read
    or write operation completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_SRAM_Initialize() routine must have been called.

    The DRV_SRAM_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_STATUS value describing the current status of the
    command.  Returns DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_COMPLETED if the client handle or the
    command handle is not valid.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE                  handle;         // Returned from DRV_SRAM_Open
    DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE     commandHandle;

  Remarks:
    This routine will not block for hardware access and will immediately return
    the current status.

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when an operation has completed.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when an operation has completed. When a client
    calls a read or a write function, it is provided with a handle identifying
    the read/write request. The driver will pass this handle back to the client
    by calling "eventHandler" function when the operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any read or
    write operations that could generate events. The event handler once set,
    persists until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler
    (which could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SRAM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SRAM driver instance.

    The DRV_SRAM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the
                   user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint32_t blockStart, nBlock;

    if(DRV_SRAM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID == commandHandle)

    {
        // The context handle was set to an application specific object. It is
        // now retrievable easily in the event handler.
        MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj = (MY_APP_OBJ *) context;
