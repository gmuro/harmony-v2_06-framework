  Output Compare Driver Interface Declarations for Static Single Instance Driver

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    help_drv_oc.h

  Summary:
    Output Compare driver interface declarations for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The Output Compare device driver provides a simple interface to manage the Output 
    Compare modules on Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the interface
    Declarations for the Output Compare driver.
    
  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.
    
    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

/* Function:
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ DRV_OC_Initialize(const SYS_MODULE_INDEX index,
                                     const SYS_MODULE_INIT * const init);

  Summary:
    Initializes the Comparator instance for the specified driver index.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Static</p>	

  Description:
    This routine initializes the Output Compare driver instance for the specified 
	driver instance, making it ready for clients to use it. The initialization
    routine is specified by the MHC parameters. The driver instance index is
    independent of the Output Compare module ID. For example, driver instance 0 
	can be assigned to Output Compare 1.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex        - Index for the driver instance to be initialized

    init            - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary
                      to initialize the driver. This pointer may be null if no
                      data is required because static overrides have been
                      provided.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver object.  Otherwise, it
    returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID. 

  Remarks:
    This function must be called before any other OC function is called.
    This function should only be called once during system initialization.
    Build configuration options may be used to statically override options in the
    "init" structure and will take precedence over initialization data passed
    using this function.

    Summary:
    Starts the Comparator instance for the specified driver index.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Static</p>	

  Description:
    This routine starts the Output Compare for the specified driver
    instance.

  Precondition:
    DRV_OC_Initialize has been called.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex    - Identifier for the object instance to be opened

                  DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                  of the driver

  Returns:
    If successful, the function returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_OC_Close function is called.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING is requested and the driver was built
    appropriately to support blocking behavior, then other client-level
    operations may block waiting on hardware until they are complete.
