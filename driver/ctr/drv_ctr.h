  Summary:
    Opens the specified CTR driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function opens the specified CTR driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_CTR_Initialize must have been called before calling
    this function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex -  Identifier for the object instance to be opened
    ioIntent -  Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                of the driver

  Returns:
    If successful, the function returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Errors can occur
	under the following circumstances:
    - if the number of client objects allocated via
         DRV_CTR_CLIENTS_NUMBER is insufficient
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
         exclusively by another client
    - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is
         invalid
    - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
         been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
    - if the driver status is not ready.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_CTR_Open(DRV_CTR_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);

  Remarks:
    The driver will always work in Non-Blocking mode even if IO-intent is
    selected as blocking.

    called.

  Summary:
    Registers a callback function for the event interrupt of CTR.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function registers a client callback function for the event interrupt 
	associated with the use-case. 
	For Wifi usecase, Only Latch 3 interrupt will be enabled, as the last event
	timestamp will be filled in latch 3 for IEEE 802.11v. 
	For USBSoF and GPIO use-cases, only one latch is needed and the interrupt
	will be enabled for the same latch.
	As per user's configuration of interrupt mode for full, half-full or every 
	trigger, the interrupt will be generated and the client callback functions 
	will be called from the ISR.
	The flag oneTimeCallback is passed as an argument for this function. If the
	value of this flag is TRUE, then the callback will be called only once. If 
	client needs one more callback, he needs to register the callback once more.
	If this value is false, then whenever interrupt is generated, the callback
	function will be called until the client call the close function.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_CTR_Initialize function must have been called.

    DRV_CTR_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle  		- A valid open instance handle, returned from the driver's open
					  function
	callback        - A function pointer for client callback function
	oneTimeCallback - If client needs callback to be called only once, then 
					  this flag must be true.
	context			- The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
				      unchanged, when the callback function is called. It can
				      be used to identify any client specific data object that
				      identifies the instance of the client module (for example,

    void ClientCallack( uintptr_t context, uint32_t * timestampbuffer,

	DRV_CTR_RegisterCallBack(handle, ClientCallack, FALSE, CLIENT_ID);
    </code>

  Remarks:
	The registered callback function will be called from ISR. So, it is 
	recommended to keep the callback functions light and not process intensive.

/* Function:
    void DRV_CTR_EventISR(SYS_MODULE_OBJ object);

  Summary:
    Interrupt Service Routine called for the CTR event interrupt.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function is called when the interrupt is generated for CTR event 
	interrupt. The latch buffers are read and stored in a local buffer, and all 
	the registered client callback functions will be called from this function.
	The number of latches to be read depends upon the use-case configured. For
	wifi, 4 latches are read, and for USBSoF and GPIO, only 1 latch is read.
	Number of buffers to read in each latch depends on the interrupt mode configuration.
	For Full, all 4 buffers needs to be read, whereas for half-full, only 2 buffers
	needs to be read and for every trigger, only 1 buffer is read.

  Precondition:
	None.
  
  Parameters:
	object - The driver instance handle returned after the initialization.
	
  Returns:
	None.
	
  Example:
	This function is not called from clients/system. This function will be called
	when the interrupt for event is generated.
	
  Remarks:
	All the handling specific for a client should be done in the respective callback
	functions. This function should not be modified.
