  Summary:
    Sets up the maximum number of hardware instances that can be supported

  Description:
    Sets up the maximum number of hardware instances that can be supported.
    It is recommended that this number be set exactly equal to the number of
    AK4953 CODEC modules that are needed by the application. Hardware Instance
    support consumes RAM memory space.
    If this macro is not defined, then the driver will be built statically.

  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    Sets up the maximum number of clients that can be connected to any hardware
    instance.

  Description:
    Sets up the maximum number of clients that can be connected to any hardware
    instance. Typically only one client could be connected to one hardware instance.
    This value represents the total number of clients to be supported
    across all hardware instances. Therefore, if there are five AK4953 hardware
	interfaces, this number will be 5.

    None.

/* AK4953 Driver Buffer Queue Entries

  Summary:
    Number of entries of all queues in all instances of the driver.

  Description:
    This macro defined the number of entries of all queues in all instances of
    the driver.

    Each hardware instance supports a buffer queue for transmit
    operations. The size of queue is specified either in driver
    initialization (for dynamic build) or by macros (for static build). The
    hardware instance transmit buffer queue will queue transmit buffers
    submitted by the DRV_AK4953_BufferAddWrite function.

    A buffer queue will contains buffer queue entries, each related to a
    BufferAdd request.  This configuration macro defines total number of buffer
    entries that will be available for use between all AK4953 driver hardware
    instances. The buffer queue entries are allocated to individual hardware
    instances as requested by hardware instances. Once the request is processed,
    the buffer queue entry is free for use by other hardware instances.

    The total number of buffer entries in the system determines the ability of
    the driver to service non blocking write requests. If a free buffer
    entry is not available, the driver will not add the request and will return
    an invalid buffer handle. More the number of buffer entries, greater the
    ability of the driver to service and add requests to its queue. A hardware
    instance additionally can queue up as many buffer entries as  specified by
    its transmit buffer queue size.

    As an example, consider the case of static single client driver application
    where full duplex non blocking operation is desired without queuing, the
    minimum transmit queue depth and minimum receive queue depth should be 1.
    Hence the total number of buffer entries should be 2.

    As an example, consider the case of a dynamic driver (say two instances) where
    instance one will queue up to three write requests and up to two read requests, and
    instance two will queue up to two write requests and up to six read requests, the
    value of this macro should be 13 (2 + 3 + 2 + 6).
