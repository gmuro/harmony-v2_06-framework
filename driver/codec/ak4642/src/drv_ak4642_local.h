  Summary:
    AK4642 Volume Mapping

  Description:
    Volume gain for Audio applications using Codec / DAC needs to be scaled as the dB range supported by the Codec is too large for human hearing.
    The allowed range of the codec stretches from +12dB to -115 dB.
    However for most applications, the entire dB range is not audible.
    So we first define the modified dB range for the driver and then normalize the volume value for that range.
    by converting max gain in dB to max gain in counts, 0x00 to 0xFF
    The MAximum and minimum values specified can be a floating point number.  It can be negative as well.
   (It is converted to codec gain counts before being used in the code.)

    None.
