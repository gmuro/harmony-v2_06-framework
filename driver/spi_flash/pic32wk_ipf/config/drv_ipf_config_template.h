  Summary:
    Determines whether the driver is implemented as static or dynamic

  Description:
    Determines whether the driver is implemented as static or dynamic. Static 
    drivers control the peripheral directly with peripheral library routines.

  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    Sets up the maximum number of hardware instances that can be supported

  Description:
    Sets up the maximum number of hardware instances that can be supported.
    It is recommended that this number be set exactly equal to the number of
    IPF modules that are needed by the application. Hardware Instance
    support consumes RAM memory space. 

  Remarks:
    As PIC32WK has only 1 instance of IPF, this macro is always set to 1.

  Summary:
    Sets up the maximum number of clients that can be connected to the hardware
    instance.

  Description:
    Sets up the maximum number of clients that can be connected to the hardware
    instance. So if IPF will be accessed by 2 clients then this number should be 2. 
    It is recommended that this be set exactly equal to the number of expected
    clients. Client support consumes RAM memory space.

  Remarks:
    None.
