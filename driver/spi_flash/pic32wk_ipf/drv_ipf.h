    been notified of the completion of the operation (after event handler
    function that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been
    retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

/* IPF SPI Flash Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary:
    Pointer to a IPF SPI Flash Driver Event handler function.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

   Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature for the IPF
    SPI Flash driver event handling callback function. A client must register
    a pointer to an event handling function whose function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values and return value are described here and
    a partial example implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write/Erase requests

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler
    (
        DRV_IPF_BLOCK_EVENT event,
        DRV_IPF_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_IPF_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer.
                break;

            case DRV_IPF_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_IPF_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    data was transferred successfully.

    If the event is DRV_IPF_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the data
    was not transferred successfully.

    The context parameter contains the a handle to the client context,
    provided at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_IPF_BlockEventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations with in this function.

    The Read, Write, and Erase functions can be called in the event handler to
    add a buffer to the driver queue. These functions can only be called to add
    buffers to the driver whose event handler is running.

  Description:
    This function opens the specified SPI Flash driver instance and provides a

    identify the caller and the instance of the driver.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_IPF_Initialize must have been called before calling
    this function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex -  Identifier for the object instance to be opened
    ioIntent -  Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                of the driver

  Returns:
    If successful, the function returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Errors can occur
	under the following circumstances:
    - if the number of client objects allocated via
         DRV_IPF_CLIENTS_NUMBER is insufficient
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
         exclusively by another client
    - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is
         invalid
    - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
         been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
    - if the driver status is not ready.

    The driver status becomes ready inside "DRV_IPF_Tasks" function. To
    make the SST Driver status ready and hence successfully "Open" the driver,
    "Task" routine need to be called periodically.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_IPF_Open(DRV_IPF_INDEX_0,

    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The driver will always work in Non-Blocking mode even if IO-intent is
    selected as blocking.

    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_IPF_Close function is
    called.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when queued operation has completed.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function
    for the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.
    When a client calls any read, write or erase function, it is provided with a
    handle identifying the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling
    "eventHandler" function when the queued operation has completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any
    read/write/erase operations that could generate events. The event handler
    once set, persists until the client closes the driver or sets another event
    handler (which could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_IPF_Initialize function must have been called for the
    specified SPI FLash driver instance.

    DRV_IPF_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the user

    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_IPF_EVENT_ERASE_COMPLETE event if the
    erase operation was successful or DRV_IPF_EVENT_ERASE_ERROR
    event if the erase operation was not successful.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_IPF_Initialize function must have been called for the

    - if the driver handle is invalid
    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_IPF_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the
    buffer was processed successfully of DRV_IPF_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_ERROR
    event if the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_IPF_Initialize function must have been called for the
    specified SPI Flash driver instance.

    DRV_IPF_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened

                   should begin. It can be any address of the flash.
    nBlock -       Total number of blocks to be written. Each write block is of
                   1 byte.

  Returns:
