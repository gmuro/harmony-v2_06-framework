/* Function:
    void DRV_SST25VF020B_BlockEraseWrite
    (
        const DRV_HANDLE handle,
        DRV_SST25VF020B_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE * commandHandle,
        void * sourceBuffer,
        uint32_t writeBlockStart,
        uint32_t nWriteBlock
    )

  Summary:
    Erase and Write blocks of data starting from a specified address in SST flash
    memory.

  Description:
    This function combines the step of erasing blocks of SST Flash and then writing 
    the data. The application can use this function if it wants to avoid having to
    explicitly delete a block in order to update the bytes contained in the block. 

    This function schedules a non-blocking operation to erase and write blocks
    of data into SST flash. The function returns with a valid buffer handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns 
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is 
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns 
    DRV_SST25VF020B_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the 
    following circumstances:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the buffer size is 0 
    - if the queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SST25VF020B_EVENT_BLOCK_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully or DRV_SST25VF020B_EVENT_ERASE_ERROR event if 
    the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Remarks:
    Refer to drv_sst25vf020b.h for usage information.
