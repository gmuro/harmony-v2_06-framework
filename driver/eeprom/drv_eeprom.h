/* EEPROM Driver command handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the read or write functions.
    This handle allows the application to track the completion of the
    operation. This command handle is also returned to the client along with
    the event that has occurred with respect to the command. This allows the
    application to connect the event to a specific command in case where
    multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

    None.

/* EEPROM Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

  Summary
    Pointer to a EEPROM Driver Event handler function

  Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the EEPROM event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value 
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to 
    receive event callbacks from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read or Write requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyEepromEventHandler
    (
        DRV_EEPROM_EVENT event,
        DRV_EEPROM_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    scheduled operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was registered using the
    DRV_EEPROM_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is passed
    back to the client as the "context" parameter. It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that scheduled the request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver's context. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations within this function.

  Description:
    This routine initializes the EEPROM driver instance for the specified
    driver index, making it ready for clients to open and use it.

  Precondition:
    None.
  
  Parameters:

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise it returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified EEPROM driver instance and provides a
    handle. This handle must be provided to all other client-level operations
    to identify the caller and the instance of the driver.
  
  Preconditions:
    DRV_EEPROM_Initialize must have been called before calling this function.
  
  Parameters:

             "ORed" together to indicate the intended use of the driver
  
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).
    
    If an error occurs, DRV_HANDLE_INVALID is returned. Errors can occur
    under the following circumstances:
    	- if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_EEPROM_CLIENTS_NUMBER 
          is insufficient
    	- if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
    	  exclusively by another client
        - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has
          already been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
        - if the driver hardware instance being opened is invalid

  Summary:
    Reads blocks of data from the specified address in EEPROM memory.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking read operation for reading blocks of
    data from the EEPROM memory. The function returns with a valid handle in
    the commandHandle argument if the read request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the driver instance queue and returns
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns
    DRV_EEPROM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the
    following circumstances:
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request
    - if the buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the number of blocks to be read is zero or more than the actual number
      of blocks available
    - if the client opened the driver in write only mode

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the command
    was processed successfully or DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if the
    command was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_EEPROM_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    EEPROM driver instance.

    DRV_EEPROM_Open must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle
                   
    buffer        - Buffer into which the data read from the EEPROM memory will
                    be placed

    blockStart    - Start block address in EEPROM memory from where the read
                    should begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be read.

  Returns:
    If the request was queued successfully then a valid command handle is
    returned in the commandHandle argument. Otherwise
    DRV_EEPROM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID is returned if the request was not
    successful.

  Example:
    <code>

    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    // address should be block aligned.
    uint32_t blockStart = EEPROM_BASE_ADDRESS_TO_READ_FROM;

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;    

    // myEEPROMHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_EEPROM_Open function.
    DRV_EEPROM_EventHandlerSet(myEEPROMHandle, APP_EEPROMEventHandler, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj);
    DRV_EEPROM_Read(myEEPROMHandle, &commandHandle, &myBuffer, blockStart, nBlock);

    if(DRV_EEPROM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID == commandHandle)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }
    else
    {

  Summary:
    Writes blocks of data starting from the specified address in EEPROM memory.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation for writing blocks
    of data into memory. The function returns with a valid handle in the
    commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled successfully. The
    function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns
    DRV_EEPROM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the
    following circumstances:
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request
    - if the buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the number of blocks to be written is either zero or more than the
      number of blocks actually available
    - if the write queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient
    - if the driver handle is invalid

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the command
    was processed successfully or DRV_EEPROM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if the
    command was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_EEPROM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    EEPROM driver instance.

    DRV_EEPROM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle. DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have
    been specified as a parameter to this routine.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle
                   
    buffer        - The buffer containing data to be programmed into EEPROM
                    memory

    blockStart    - Start block address of EEPROM memory where the write should
                    begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be written. 

  Returns:
    If the request was queued successfully then a valid command handle is
    returned in the commandHandle argument. Otherwise
    DRV_EEPROM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID is returned if the request was not
    successful.

  Example:
    <code>
    
    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed. When a client
    calls a read, write or a erase function, it is provided with a handle
    identifying the command that was added to the driver's command queue. The
    driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler"
    function when the queued operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any read, write
    or erase operations that could generate events. The event handler once set,
    persists until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler
    (which could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_EEPROM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    EEPROM driver instance.

    The DRV_EEPROM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the
                   user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

  Returns:
    Always returns false.

  Example:
    <code>

    // The EEPROM media is treated as always writeable.
    bool isWriteProtected;
    isWriteProtected = DRV_EEPROM_IsWriteProtected(drvEEPROMHandle);

    </code>

  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    Returns the EEPROM media start address

  Description:
    This function returns the EEPROM Media start address.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_EEPROM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified 
    EEPROM driver instance.

    The DRV_EEPROM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

  Returns:
    Start address of the EEPROM Media if the handle is valid otherwise NULL.

  Example:
    <code>

    uintptr_t startAddress;
    startAddress = DRV_EEPROM_AddressGet(drvEEPROMHandle);

    </code>

  Remarks:
    None.
