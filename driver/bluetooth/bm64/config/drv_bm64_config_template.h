/* Use Deprecated MMI Commands?

  Summary
    Identifies whether the driver should use deprecated MMI commands. 

  Description
    There are currently two versions of the BM64 Audio UART Command Set, which is used
    by the PIC32 to send commands to the BM64 module and receive responses (events) back
    from the BM64.  The original is version 1.00 and the updated one is version 2.0x.
    Version 2.0x deprecates some MMI commands, and adds some new commands to replace them.
    
    If the DRV_BM64_PlayPreviousSong and DRV_BM64_PlayNextSong functions are not working
    but other AVRCP functions are working properly, try unchcing this option. 

    true (checked, default) - use deprecated MMI commands.
    false (unchecked) - do not deprecated MMI commands.

  Remarks:
    None

/* Include HFP,A2DP,AVRCP protocols?

  Summary
    Identifies whether the driver should include HFP,A2DP,AVRCP functionality. 

  Description
    Identifies whether the driver should include the interface to support HFP, A2DP and AVRCP
    protocols, which by default also brings in the I2S driver and the default codec based on
    the BSP selected.

    If you are building a BLE-only application, uncheck this option.

    true (checked, default) - include HFP,A2DP,AVRCP functionality.
    false (unchecked) - do not include HFP,A2DP,AVRCP functionality.

  Remarks:
    None

/* Include BLE features?

  Summary
    Identifies whether the driver should include BLE

  Description
    Identifies whether the driver should include BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
    functions.

    This option currently does not have any effect on the code size.

    true (checked, default) - include BLE functionality.
    false (unchecked) - do not include BLE functionality.

  Remarks:
    None
