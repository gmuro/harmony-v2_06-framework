/* SQI Driver instance configuration

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of Driver instances that can be supported by
    the dynamic driver.

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of Driver instances that can be
    supported by the dynamic driver. In case of this driver, multiple instances
    of the driver could use the same hardware instance.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SQI maximum number of clients

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of clients

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of clients that the SQI driver
    can supported at run time. This constant defines the total number of SQI
    driver clients that will be available to all instances of the SQI driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SQI Driver maximum number of buffer objects

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of buffer objects

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of buffer objects. This
    indirectly also specifies the queue depth. The SQI Driver can queue up
    DRV_SQI_BUFFER_OBJECT_NUMBER of read/write/erase requests before return a
    DRV_SQI_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID due to the queue being full. Buffer objects
    are shared by all instances of the driver. Increasing this number increases
    the RAM requirement of the driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SQI Driver maximum number DMA Buffer Descriptors

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of DMA Buffer descriptors to be used by the
    driver.

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of DMA buffer descriptor
    objects.  The SQI Driver can queue up to
    DRV_SQI_DMA_BUFFER_DESCRIPTORS_NUMBER of transactions to be processed by
    the hardware. DMA buffer desired are shared by all instances of the driver.
    Increasing this number increases the RAM requirement of the driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* SQI interrupt and polled mode operation control

  Summary:
    Macro specifies operation of the driver to be in the interrupt mode
    or polled mode

  Description:
    This macro specifies operation of the driver to be in the interrupt mode
    or polled mode

    - true  - Select if interrupt mode of SQI operation is desired
    - false - Select if polling mode of SQI operation is desired

    Not defining this option to true or false will result in build error.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.
