    application to connect the event to a specific transfer request in case
    where multiple requests are queued.

    The command handle associated with the transfer request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the request (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the request has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

/* SQI Driver Event Handler Function Pointer data type.

   Summary:
    Pointer to a SQI Driver Event handler function

   Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SQI driver
    event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to a
    event handling function the signature(parameter and return value types) of
    which should match the types specified by this function pointer in order to
    receive transfer request related event call backs from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    commandHandle   - Handle identifying the transfer request to which this
                      event relates

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void MyAppCommandEventHandler
    (
        DRV_SQI_EVENT event,
        DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT)context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:
                // Handle the completed transfer request.
                break;

            case DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:
                // Handle the failed transfer request.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, that the operation
    associated with the transfer request was completed successfully. If the
    event is DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, there was an error while executing
    the transfer request.

    The context parameter contains context details provided by the client as
    part of registering the event handler function. This context value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter. It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) of the client that made the request.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified SQI driver instance and returns a handle to it.
  
  Description:
    This routine opens the specified SQI driver instance and provides a handle
    identifying the SQI driver instance. This handle must be provided to all
    other client-level operations to identify the caller and the instance of
    the driver.
  
  Preconditions:
    Function DRV_SQI_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.
  
  Parameters:
    index  - Identifier for the object instance to be opened.

    intent - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration DRV_IO_INTENT
             "ORed" together to indicate the intended use of the driver.
  
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).
    
    If an error occurs, DRV_HANDLE_INVALID is returned. Errors can occur
    under the following circumstances:
        - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_SQI_CLIENTS_NUMBER
          is insufficient
        - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
          exclusively by another client
        - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has
          already been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
        - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is
          invalid
  
  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;
    
    handle = DRV_SQI_Open(DRV_SQI_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);
    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>
  
  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_SQI_Close routine is called.
    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the driver has has
    already been opened, it cannot be opened exclusively.

  Description:
    This routine closes an opened-instance of the SQI driver, invalidating the
    handle.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SQI driver instance.

    DRV_SQI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;  // Returned from DRV_SQI_Open

    DRV_SQI_Close(handle);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used
    with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by
    calling DRV_SQI_Open before the caller may use the driver again. Usually
    there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation

  Summary:
    Queue a transfer request operation on the SQI device.

  Description:
    This routine queues a transfer request operation on the SQI device. In
    order to perform any operation on the sqi flash device, a one byte
    instruction specifying the operation to be performed needs to be sent out.
    This is followed by optional address from/to which data is to be
    read/written, option, dummy and data bytes.

    If an event handler is registered with the driver the event handler would
    be invoked with the status of the operation once the operation has been
    completed. The function returns DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the
    commandHandle argument under the following circumstances:
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the transfer element is NULL or number of transfer elements is zero
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SQI 
    driver instance.

    DRV_SQI_Open must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the handle to the
                    track the status of the transfer request.

    frame         - Pointer to the transfer frame array.

    numFrames     - Number of elements in the transfer frame array.

  Returns:
    The handle to the transfer request is returned in the commandHandle
    argument. It will be DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not
    successful.

  Example:

  Summary:
    Queue a data transfer operation on the specified SQI device.

  Description:
    This routine queues a data transfer operation on the specified SQI device.
    The reads or writes of blocks of data generally involves sending down the
    read or a write command, the address on the device from/to which data is to
    be read/written. The client also has to specify the source or destination
    buffer and the number of bytes to be read or written. The client builds an
    array of transfer elements containing these information and passes the
    array and the number of elements of the array as part of this transfer
    operation. If an event handler is registered with the driver the event
    handler would be invoked with the status of the operation once the
    operation has been completed. The function returns
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the
    following circumstances:
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the transfer element is NULL or number of transfer elements is zero
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SQI 
    driver instance.

    DRV_SQI_Open must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle

    sqiDevice     - The SQI device index on which the operation is to be
                    performed.
                   
    xferData      - Pointer to the transfer elements array.

    numElements   - Number of elements in the transfer elements array.

  Returns:
    The handle to the command request is returned in the commandHandle
    argument. It will be DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not
    successful.

  Example:

  Summary:

  Description:
    This routine gets the current status of the tranfer request. The
    application must use this routine where the status of a scheduled transfer
    request needs to polled on. The function may return
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_COMPLETED in a case where the handle has expired. A handle
    expires when the internal buffer object is re-assigned to another transfer
    request. It is recommended that this function be called regularly in order
    to track the status of the transfer request correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive the
    transfer completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize() routine must have been called.

    The DRV_SQI_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open
             routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_SQI_COMMAND_STATUS value describing the current status of the
    transfer request. Returns DRV_SQI_COMMAND_ERROR_UNKNOWN if the client
    handle or the handle is not valid.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE                  handle;         // Returned from DRV_SQI_Open
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE      commandHandle;

  Summary:
    Allows a client to register an event handling function, which the driver
    can invoke when the queued transfer request has completed.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed. When a client
    queues a transfer request with the driver, it is provided with a handle
    identifying the transfer request that was added to the driver's buffer
    queue. The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling
    "eventHandler" function when the queued operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any transfer
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SQI driver instance.

    The DRV_SQI_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the
                   user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

        // The context handle was set to an application specific object. It is
        // now retrievable easily in the event handler.

                break;
        }

    If the client does not want to be notified when the queued operation has
    completed, it does not need to register a callback.
