/*******************************************************************************
  Motor Control PWM (MCPWM) Driver Interface Declarations for Static Single Instance Driver

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_mcpwm.h

  Summary:
    MCPWM driver interface declarations for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The MCPWM device driver provides a simple interface to manage the MCPWM module on 
    Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the interface Declarations for the 
    MCPWM driver.
    
  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.
    
    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

/* Function:
    void DRV_MCPWM_Initialize(void)

  Summary:
    Initializes the MCPWM instance for the specified driver index.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Static</p>	

  Description:
    This routine initializes the MCPWM Driver instance for the specified driver
    instance, making it ready for clients to use it. The initialization
    routine is specified by the MHC parameters.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other MCPWM routine is called.
    This routine should only be called once during system initialization.
