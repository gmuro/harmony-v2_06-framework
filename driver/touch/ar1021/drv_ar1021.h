  Summary:
    Initializes the  AR1021 instance for the specified driver index

  Description:
    This routine initializes the  AR1021 driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the 'init' parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the  AR1021 module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to  AR10212.  If the driver is built statically, then some of the
    initialization parameters are overridden by configuration macros. Refer to
    the description of the DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_INIT data structure for more details on
    which members on this data structure are overridden.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Input:
    index  - Identifier for the instance to be initialized.  Please note this
             is not the  AR1021 id.  The hardware  AR1021 id is set in the initialization
             structure.  This is the index of the driver index to use.

    init   - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver. If this pointer is NULL, the driver
             uses the static initialization override macros for each
             member of the initialization data structure.

  Return:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_TOUCH_INIT      drvAr1021InitData;
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      objectHandle;

    objectHandle = DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize(DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_INDEX_1, (SYS_MODULE_INIT*)drvAr1021InitData);
    if (SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID == objectHandle)
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>
  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other AR1021 routine is called.

    This routine should only be called once during system initialization
    unless DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Deinitialize is called to deinitialize the driver
    instance. This routine will NEVER block for hardware access.

  Function:
    void DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Deinitialize ( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object )

  Summary:
    De-initializes the specified instance of the  AR1021 driver module.

  Description:
    De-initializes the specified instance of the  AR1021 driver module,
    disabling its operation (and any hardware) and invalidates all of the
    internal data.

  Conditions:
    Function DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    routine and a valid SYS_MODULE_OBJ must have been returned.

  Input:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize

  Return:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     //  Returned from DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Deinitialize ( object );

    {
        // Check again later if you need to know
        // when the driver is deinitialized.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Once the Initialize operation has been called, the De-initialize
    operation must be called before the Initialize operation can be called
    again.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the operation
    requires time to allow the hardware to complete, this will be reported
    by the DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Status operation. The system has to use DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Status
    to find out when the module is in the ready state.

  Function:
    SYS_STATUS DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Status ( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object )

  Summary:
    Provides the current status of the  AR1021 driver module.

  Description:
    This function provides the current status of the  AR1021 driver module.

  Conditions:
    The DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize function must have been called before calling
    this function.

  Input:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize

  Return:
    SYS_STATUS_READY - Indicates that the driver is busy with a previous
    system level operation and cannot start another

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     // Returned from DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    status = DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Status( object );
    if( SYS_STATUS_READY != status )
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Any value greater than SYS_STATUS_READY is also a normal running state
    in which the driver is ready to accept new operations.

    SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED - Indicates that the driver has been
    deinitialized

    This value is less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR.

    This function can be used to determine when any of the driver's module
    level operations has completed.

    If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_BUSY, the previous operation
    has not yet completed. Once the status operation returns
    SYS_STATUS_READY, any previous operations have completed.

    The value of SYS_STATUS_ERROR is negative (-1). Any value less than
    that is also an error state.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be
    cleared by calling the reinitialize operation. If that fails, the
    deinitialize operation will need to be called, followed by the
    initialize operation to return to normal operations.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified AR1021 driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>
 
  Description:
    This routine opens the specified AR1021 driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    The current version of driver does not support the DRV_IO_INTENT feature.
    The driver is by default non-blocking. The driver can perform both read
    and write to the AR1021 device. The driver supports single client only.
  
  Precondition:
    The DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize function must have been called before 
    calling this function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex -  Index of the driver initialized with
                DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize().
                
    intent -    Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                DRV_IO_INTENT ORed together to indicate the intended use of
                the driver. The current version of driver does not support
				the selective IO intent feature.
 
  Return:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. An error
    can occur when the following is true:
      * if the number of client objects allocated via
        DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_CLIENTS_NUMBER is insufficient
      * if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been
        opened exclusively by another client
      * if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or
        is invalid

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE  handle;

    handle = DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Open( DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE );

    if( DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle )
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Close routine is
    called. This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the
    requested intent flags are not supported, the routine will return
    DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. This function is thread safe in a RTOS application.
    It should not be called in an ISR.

/* Function:

  Description:

  Precondition:
    The DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified

  Remarks:

    calling DRV_TOUCH_AR1021_Open before the caller may use the driver again.  This
