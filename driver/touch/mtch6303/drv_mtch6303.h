  Summary:
    MTCH6303 driver interface declarations for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The MTCH6303 device driver provides a simple interface to manage the MTCH6303
    module. This file defines the interface Declarations for the MTCH6303 driver.
    
  Remarks:
    Static single instance driver interface eliminates the need for an object ID
    or object handle.
    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

  Summary:

  Description:
    A buffer handle value is returned by a call to the 
    DRV_MTCH6303_AddRegisterRead, DRV_MTCH6303_AddRegisterWrite or
    DRV_MTCH6303_TouchInputRead functions. This handle is associated with the
    buffer passed into the function and it allows the application to track the
    completion of the data from (or into) that buffer.  The buffer handle value
    returned from these functions is returned back to the client 
    by the "event handler callback" function registered with the driver.

    The buffer handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has 
    been notified of the completion of the buffer transfer (after event handler 
    function that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been 
    retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

  Summary:

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify a buffer event handling function 
    for the driver to call back when queued buffer transfers have finished.  
    When a client calls either the DRV_MTCH6303_TouchInputRead, 
    DRV_MTCH6303_AddRegisterRead or DRV_MTCH6303_AddRegisterWrite function, it 
    is provided with a handle identifying the buffer that was added to the 
    driver's buffer queue. The driver will pass this handle back to the client 
    by calling "eventHandler" function when the buffer transfer has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "buffer add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists 
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which 
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MTCH6303_Initialize routine must have been called and the 
    DRV_MTCH6303_Status must have returned SYS_STATUS_READY.

  Parameters:
    
    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify a message event handling function

    When a client calls either the DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_AddTouchInputRead, 
    DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_AddMessageReportRead or 
    DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_AddMessageCommandWrite function, it is provided with a 
    handle identifying the message that was added to the driver's message queue. 
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler" 
    function when the message transfer has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "message add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists 
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which 
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MTCH6303_Initialize routine must have been called and the 
    DRV_MTCH6303_Status must have returned SYS_STATUS_READY.

  Parameters:
    
    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Summary:
    Schedules a non-blocking read buffer request to read touch input from MTCH6303.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking read buffer request to read touch 
    input from MTCH6303.  The function returns with a valid buffer handle in the
    bufferHandle argument if the read request was scheduled successfully. The 
    function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns
    immediately. The function returns DRV_MTCH6303_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID in the 
    bufferHandle argument:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the buffer size is 0 
    - if the read queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_MTCH6303_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer 
    was processed successfully or DRV_MTCH6303_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the 
    buffer was not processed successfully. The touch data is collected into 
    touchData and can be read once a buffer event complete is reported. A event 
    handler is called on buffer event complete where the touch data must be read
    from touchData.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MTCH6303_Initialize routine must have been called and the 
    DRV_MTCH6303_Status must have returned SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_MTCH6303_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device 
    handle.

  Parameters:
    bufferHandle - Handle to the buffer scheduled.
    
    touchData - Buffer collecting touch data.

  Returns:
    None.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking register write request to write I2C
    accessible MTCH6303 registers. The function returns with a valid buffer handle 
    in the bufferHandle argument if the register write request was scheduled 
    successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and 
    returns immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer

    - if the write queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_MTCH6303_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer 
    was processed successfully or DRV_MTCH6303_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the 
    buffer was not processed successfully. A event handler is called on buffer 
    event complete where the application data is written to the I2C accessible
    MTCH6303 Register. 

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MTCH6303_Initialize routine must have been called and the 
    DRV_MTCH6303_Status must have returned SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_MTCH6303_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device 
    handle.

  Parameters:
    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer handle.

    destination  - Index to the start of destination register list.

    nBytes       - number of registers.

    source       - pointer to the data to be written to the register.

  Returns:
    None.

  Summary:
    Schedule a non-blocking driver command message write operation to write 
    command message to MTCH6303 registers.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking command message write request to write 
    command message to MTCH6303. The function returns with a valid buffer handle 
    in the bufferHandle argument if the register command message write request 
    was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware 
    instance queue and returns immediately. While the request is in the queue, 
    the application message buffer is owned by the driver and should not be 
    modified. The function returns DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID in 
    the bufferHandle argument:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the buffer size is 0 
    - if the message write queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the 
    buffer was processed successfully or DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR 
    event if the buffer was not processed successfully. A event handler is called 
    on buffer event complete where the application command message is written to
    MTCH6303. 

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MTCH6303_Initialize routine must have been called and the 
    DRV_MTCH6303_Status must have returned SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_MTCH6303_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device 
    handle.

  Parameters:
    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer handle.

    messageCmd - command message to write to MTCH6303.

    messageSize - command message size. It includes message header and payload size.

  Returns:
    None.

    <code>

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;    
    DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_MESSAGE messageCommand;

  Summary:
    Maps the raw touch input to display resolution.

  Description:
    This function maps the raw touch input to display resolution. Raw touch input
    touchValue is obtained from the individual x or y value of 
    DRV_MTCH6303_TOUCH_DATA. Raw touch value varies from 0 to 0x7FFF. The 
    displayResolution is either horizontal or vertical resolution of the display
    in pixels. The function returns the raw touch input mapped to display 
    resolution in form of number of pixels.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    touchValue - raw touch input either in x or y direction (0 - 0x7FFF).

    dispResolution  - display resolution specifying either width or height of 
                      the display in pixels.

  Return:
    This function returns the raw touch input mapped to display resolution in 
    form of number of pixels.
 
  Example:
    <code>

      // Display with resolution 800 x 480
      #define DISP_HOR_RESOUTION  800
      #define DISP_VER_RESOLUTION 480

      uint16_t touchY; 
      
      // map 0th touch packet to display resolution
      rawTouchX = touchData.touch[0].x;
      rawTouchY = touchData.touch[0].y;

      // map raw touch input in x direction to display horizontal resolution
      touchX = DRV_MTCH6303_TouchInputMap( rawTouchX, DISP_HOR_RESOLUTION );

      // map raw touch input in y direction to display vertical resolution
      touchY = DRV_MTCH6303_TouchInputMap( rawTouchY, DISP_VER_RESOLUTION );
 
      // use touchX and touchY as input to graphics objects.
