  MTCH6303 Driver Functions for Static Single Instance Driver

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_mtch6303_static.c

  Summary:
    MTCH6303 driver impementation for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The MTCH6303 device driver provides a simple interface to manage the MTCH6303
    modules. This file contains implemenation for the MTCH6303 driver.
    
  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.
    
    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.
