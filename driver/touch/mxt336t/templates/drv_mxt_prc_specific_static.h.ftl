  MXT336T Driver Interface Declarations for Processor Compatibility

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_mxt_prc_specific_static.h

  Summary:
    MXT336T driver interface declarations for Processor Compatibility.

  Description:
    The MXT336T device driver provides a simple interface to manage the MXT336T
    modules. This file defines the interface Declarations for the MXT336T driver.

  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.

    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.
