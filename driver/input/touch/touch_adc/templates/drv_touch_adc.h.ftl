  Summary:
    Initializes the Resistive Touch ADC Driver instance for the specified driver index

  Description:
    This function initializes the Resistive Touch ADC Driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the 'init' parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to Touch ADC.  If the driver is built statically, then some of the
    initialization parameters are overridden by configuration macros. Refer to
    the description of the DRV_TOUCH_ADC_INIT data structure for more details on
    which members on this data structure are overridden.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    index  - Identifier for the instance to be initialized.  Please note this
             is not the Driver ID.  The hardware ADC Driver ID
			 is set in the initialization structure.  This is the index of the 
			 driver index to use.
    init   - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver. If this pointer is NULL, the driver
             uses the static initialization override macros for each
             member of the initialization data structure.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_TOUCH_ADC_INIT        init;
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      objectHandle;

    // Populate the Touch ADC initialization structure
    init.spiId              = DRV_TOUCH_ADC_ID_1;

    objectHandle = DRV_TOUCH_ADCT_Initialize(DRV_TOUCH_ADC_INDEX_1, (SYS_MODULE_INIT*)init);
    if (SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID == objectHandle)
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>
  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other DRV_TOUCH_ADC routine is called.

    This routine should only be called once during system initialization
    unless DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Deinitialize is called to deinitialize the driver
    instance. This routine will NEVER block for hardware access.

/*
  Function:
    void DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Deinitialize ( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object )

  Summary:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the Touch ADC driver module.

  Description:
    This function deinitializes the specified instance of the Touch ADC Driver
    module, disabling its operation (and any hardware) and invalidates all of the
    internal data.

  Preconditions:
    DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    routine and a valid SYS_MODULE_OBJ must have been returned.

  Parameters:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     //  Returned from DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Deinitialize ( object );

    status = DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Status( object );
    if( SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED == status )
    {
        // Check again later if you need to know
        // when the driver is deinitialized.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Once the Initialize operation has been called, the Deinitialize
    operation must be called before the Initialize operation can be called
    again.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the operation
    requires time to allow the hardware to complete, this will be reported
    by the DRV_TOUCH_ADCT_Status operation. The system has to use
    DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Status to determine when the module is in the ready state.

  Summary:

  Description:
    This function provides the current status of the DRV_TOUCH_ADC driver module.

  Preconditions:
    DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize must have been called before calling
    this function.

  Parameters:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize

  Returns:
    SYS_STATUS_READY - Indicates that the driver is busy with a previous
    system level operation and cannot start another

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     // Returned from DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    if( SYS_STATUS_READY != status )
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Any value greater than SYS_STATUS_READY is also a normal running state
    in which the driver is ready to accept new operations.

    SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED - Indicates that the driver has been
    deinitialized

    This value is less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR.

    This function can be used to determine when any of the driver's module
    level operations has completed.

    If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_BUSY, the previous operation
    has not yet completed. Once the status operation returns
    SYS_STATUS_READY, any previous operations have completed.

    The value of SYS_STATUS_ERROR is negative (-1). Any value less than
    that is also an error state.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be
    cleared by calling the reinitialize operation. If that fails, the
    deinitialize operation will need to be called, followed by the
    initialize operation to return to normal operations.

                                         const DRV_IO_INTENT    intent )

  Summary:
    Opens the specified Touch driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	
  Description:
    This function opens the specified Touch driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    The DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING and DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING ioIntent
    options additionally affect the behavior of the DRV_USART_Read() and
    DRV_USART_Write() functions. If the ioIntent is
    DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING, then these function will not block even if
    the required amount of data could not be processed. If the ioIntent is
    DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING, these functions will block until the required
    amount of data is processed.

    If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_READ, the client will only be read from
    the driver. If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE, the client will only be
    able to write to the driver. If the ioIntent in
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE, the client will be able to do both, read and
    write.

    Specifying a DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE will cause the driver to provide
    exclusive access to this client. The driver cannot be opened by any
    other client.
	
  Preconditions:
    DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize must have been called before calling
    this function.
	
  Parameters:
    drvIndex -  Index of the driver initialized with DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Initialize.
                Please note this is not the SPI id.
    intent -    Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                DRV_IO_INTENT ORed together to indicate the intended use of
                the driver
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. An error
    can occur when the following is true:
      * if the number of client objects allocated via
        DRV_TOUCH_ADC_CLIENTS_NUMBER is insufficient
      * if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been
        opened exclusively by another client
      * if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or
        is invalid
		
  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE  handle;

    handle = DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Open( DRV_TOUCH_ADC_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE );

    if( DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle )
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>
	
  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_TOUCH_ADC_Close routine is
    called. This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the
    requested intent flags are not supported, the routine will return
    DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. This function is thread safe in a RTOS application.
    It should not be called in an ISR.

  Remarks:
