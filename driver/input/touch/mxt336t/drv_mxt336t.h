/* Function:
      SYS_MODULE_OBJ DRV_MXT336T_Initialize(const SYS_MODULE_INDEX index,
                                           const SYS_MODULE_INIT * const init )

  Summary:
    Initializes the MXT336T instance for the specified driver index

  Description:
    This routine initializes the MXT336T driver instance for the specified
    driver index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The
    initialization data is specified by the 'init' parameter. The initialization
    may fail if the number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if
    the specified driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance
    index is independent of the MXT336T module ID. For example, driver instance
    0 can be assigned to MXT336T2.  If the driver is built statically, then
    some of the initialization parameters are overridden by configuration
    macros. Refer to the description of the DRV_MXT336T_INIT data
    structure for more details on which members on this data structure are
    overridden.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    index  - Identifier for the instance to be initialized.  Please note this
             is not the MXT336T ID.  The hardware MXT336T ID is set in the
             initialization structure. This is the index of the driver index to
             use.

    init   - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver. If this pointer is NULL, the driver
             uses the static initialization override macros for each
             member of the initialization data structure.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_MXT336T_INIT        init;
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      objectHandle;

    // Populate the MXT336T initialization structure
    // Touch Module Id
    init.moduleInit                  = {0},
    init.touchId                     = DRV_TOUCH_INDEX_0,
    init.drvInitialize               = NULL,
    init.drvOpen                     = DRV_I2C_Open,
    init.interruptSource             = INT_SOURCE_EXTERNAL_1,
    init.interruptChannel            = PORT_CHANNEL_D,
    init.interruptPin                = PORTS_BIT_POS_1,
    init.resetChannel                = PORT_CHANNEL_A,
    init.resetPin                    = PORTS_BIT_POS_14,

    objectHandle = DRV_MXT336T_Initialize(DRV_TOUCH_INDEX_0,
                                              (SYS_MODULE_INIT*)init);
    if (SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID == objectHandle)
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other MXT336T routine is called.

    This routine should only be called once during system initialization
    unless DRV_MXT336T_Deinitialize is called to deinitialize the driver
    instance. This routine will NEVER block for hardware access.

/*************************************************************************
  Function:
       void DRV_MXT336T_Deinitialize ( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object )

  Summary:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the MXT336T driver module.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the MXT336T driver module,
    disabling its operation (and any hardware) and invalidates all of the
    internal data.

  Preconditions:
    Function DRV_MXT336T_Initialize must have been called before calling 
    this routine and a valid SYS_MODULE_OBJ must have been returned.

  Parameter:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_MXT336T_Initialize

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;    //Returned from DRV_MXT336T_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    DRV_MXT336T_Deinitialize ( object );

    status = DRV_MXT336T_Status( object );
    if( SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED == status )
    {
        // Check again later if you need to know
        // when the driver is deinitialized.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Once the Initialize operation has been called, the De-initialize
    operation must be called before the Initialize operation can be called
    again.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the operation
    requires time to allow the hardware to complete, this will be reported
    by the DRV_MXT336T_Status operation. The system has to use
    DRV_MXT336T_Status to determine when the module is in the ready state.

  Function:

  Summary:
    Provides the current status of the MXT336T driver module.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function provides the current status of the MXT336T driver module.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MXT336T_Initialize function must have been called before 
    calling this function.

  Parameters:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_MXT336T_Initialize

  Returns:
    SYS_STATUS_READY - Indicates that the driver is busy with a previous
    system-level operation and cannot start another

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;  // Returned from DRV_MXT336T_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    status = DRV_MXT336T_Status( object );
    if( SYS_STATUS_READY != status )
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Any value greater than SYS_STATUS_READY is also a normal running state
    in which the driver is ready to accept new operations.

    SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED - Indicates that the driver has been
    deinitialized

    This value is less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR.

    This function can be used to determine when any of the driver's module
    level operations has completed.

    If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_BUSY, the previous operation
    has not yet completed. Once the status operation returns
    SYS_STATUS_READY, any previous operations have completed.

    The value of SYS_STATUS_ERROR is negative (-1). Any value less than
    that is also an error state.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be
    cleared by calling the reinitialize operation. If that fails, the
    deinitialize operation will need to be called, followed by the
    initialize operation to return to normal operations.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified MXT336T driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>
	
  Description:
    This routine opens the specified MXT336T driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    The current version of driver does not support the DRV_IO_INTENT feature.
    The driver is by default non-blocking. The driver can perform both read
    and write to the MXT336T device. The driver supports single client only.	
	
  Precondition:
    The DRV_MXT336T_Initialize function must have been called before 
    calling this function.
	
  Parameters:
    drvIndex -  Index of the driver initialized with
                DRV_MXT336T_Initialize().
                
    intent -    Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                DRV_IO_INTENT ORed together to indicate the intended use of
                the driver. The current version of driver does not support
				the selective IO intent feature.
				
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. An error
    can occur when the following is true:
      * if the number of client objects allocated via
        DRV_MXT336T_CLIENTS_NUMBER is insufficient
      * if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been
        opened exclusively by another client
      * if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or
        is invalid
		
  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE  handle;

    handle = DRV_MXT336T_Open( DRV_MXT336T_INDEX_0,
                                      DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE );

    if( DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle )
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>
	
  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_MXT336T_Close routine is
    called. This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the
    requested intent flags are not supported, the routine will return
    DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. This function is thread safe in a RTOS application.
    It should not be called in an ISR.

/* Function:

  Summary:
    Closes an opened instance of the MXT336T driver.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function closes an opened instance of the MXT336T driver, invalidating
    the handle.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_MXT336T_Initialize routine must have been called for the 
    specified MXT336T driver instance.

    DRV_MXT336T_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    None

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;  // Returned from DRV_MXT336T_Open

    </code>

  Remarks:
	After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be 
    used with any of the remaining driver routines.  A new handle must be
    obtained by calling DRV_MXT336T_Open before the caller may use the
    driver again. This function is thread safe in a RTOS application.

    Note: Usually, there is no need for the driver client to verify that the 
          Close operation has completed.
