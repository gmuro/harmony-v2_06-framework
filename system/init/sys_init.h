  Function:
    void SYS_Initialize ( void *data )

  Summary:
    Initializes the board, services, drivers, and other modules

  Description:
    This function initializes the board, services, drivers, and other modules
    as configured at build time.  It should be called almost immediately after 
    entering the "main" function.

  Precondition:
    The C-language run-time environment and stack must have been initialized.
  
  Parameters:
    data        - Pointer to any system initialization data required.  Normally
                  passed as NULL for static system implementations.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    int main ( void )
    {
        SYS_Initialize(NULL);
        
        while (true)
        {
            SYS_Tasks();
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Basic System Initialization Sequence:
    
    1.  Initialize core processor services.
    2.  Initialize board support package.
    3.  Initialize RTOS (if utilized).
    4.  Initialize drivers.
    5.  Initialize system services.
    6.  Initialize middleware. 
    7.  Initialize application(s).

    This function may be overridden and implemented as desired as long as it
    appropriately initializes all necessary board, services, and modules.

    Most MPLAB Harmony libraries are designed so that the order in which they 
    are initialized is not important.  However, core processor services and
    board support packgage initialization should be completed before any other
    initialization takes place and RTOS initialization (if utilized) shoudl take 
    palce before drivers, system services and middleware are initialized. 
    Applications should be initialized last.
